# Collection-and-processing-of-sensory-data

The goal of this lab exercise is to build a model-based centralized distributed system client-server for sensing environmental parameters. During the build software solution, I use gRPC' technologies and transmission-based web services representation of the state of the resource (REST). This exercise consists of three parts: 
- studying program code examples from lectures (gRPC and web services)
- design and implementation of a distributed system server that maintains information about sensors 
- design and implementation of a distributed system client representing a sensor for parameters environment



## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.
